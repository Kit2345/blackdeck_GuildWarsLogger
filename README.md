# blackdeck_GuildWarsLogger

# Purpose of this app:

Record your guild wars attacks to help plan future attacks.

# Why?

I noticed our guild leader was always refering to past matches to help plan our attacks for the day. With this app, the data should be more easily viewable, and you will be able to access data that is more than a week old (current limitation of in-game data).

# What do I get out of this?

I want to practice making full-stack apps, and for this particular app I wanted to use Python and OOP (both new to me).

# Is there anything you can do to help?

Absolutely. Patience - remember I am new to software development, and this is a hobby project. Feedback both good and bad is valuable. Answering questions such as:

- What do you like and dislike about this app?
- Is there any features you think are missing and would like/find useful?
- Are you using this app currently? If not why not?
- Do you enjoy using this app?
